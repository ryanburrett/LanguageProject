The aim of this project was to improve the medical literacy of people with communication and learning difficulties by developing a system to help doctors explain complex idea in a simple way. The developed application would be used by doctors as a tool to access and create simplified information about medical conditions. These would then be given to appropriate patients as an aide to help them understand their own health. The author aimed to use a combination of simple text and supplementary images to allow people with communication or learning difficulties to get the maximum information from anything produced by the system. Ultimately the system was developed successfully and the ability to create and search for simplified medical condition was added. The evaluations of created medical condition summaries, produced with the system, allowed for the discovery of work sort of creation method worked best. Guidelines were able to be recommended for how to use images as effectively as possible when creating a new condition summary.
